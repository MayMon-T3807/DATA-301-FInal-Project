# DATA-301-FInal-Project

Final Project Proposal

Imagine you are spending a long holiday at home, enjoying some films, but you don’t know what to watch. For example, you like sci-fi and horror films, but before watching a film, you search for reviews to determine if it’s worth your time. However, this process can take another two or three hours. You don't want to waste your time like this. 

Instead, you need a system that can make decisions for you based on your preferences or favorite genres.

Here, we will implement a movie recommendation system where a user doesn’t have to manually search for reviews.

We will perform a comparative analysis of two data structures—Trees and Graphs—to determine which one performs better in terms of:

(1) Time complexity

(2) Program performance

(3) Efficiency
